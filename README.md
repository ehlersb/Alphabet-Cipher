Alphabet Cipher (#355) from /r/DailyProgrammer

I was able to figure out a solution by using a static array of characters representing the alphabet. I think it may have been
easier in hindsight to utilize numerical ascii codes to encrypt the message. However, my solution works, albeit it is a little more
complex than it maybe could have been.
